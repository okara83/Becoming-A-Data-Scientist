    "Like you use parentheses to structure mathematical expressions, **(2 + 2) * 2** versus **2 + (2 * 2)**, you use parentheses to structure regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example regex that does this is **'a(b|c)'**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole content enclosed in the opening and closing parentheses is called matching group (or capture group). You can have multiple matching groups in a single regex. And you can even have hierarchical matching groups, for example **'a(b|(cd))'**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One big advantage of a matching group is that it captures the matched substring. You can retrieve it in other parts of the regular expression---or after analyzing the result of the whole regex matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a short example for the most basic use of a matching group---to structure the regex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you create regex b?(a.)* with the matching group (a.) that matches all patterns starting with zero or one occurrence of character 'b' and an arbitrary number of two-character-sequences starting with the character 'a'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the strings **'bacacaca', 'aaaa', ''** (the empty string), and **'Xababababab'** all match your regex.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of the parentheses for structuring the regular expression is intuitive and should come naturally to you because the same rules apply as for arithmetic operations. However, there's a more advanced use of regex groups: **retrieval**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can retrieve the matched content of each matching group. So the next question naturally arises:\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Get the First Matching Group?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two scenarios when you want to access the content of your matching groups:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Access the matching group in the regex pattern to reuse partially matched text from one group somewhere else.\n",
    " 2. Access the matching group after the whole match operation to analyze the matched text in your Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, you simply get the first matching group with the **\\number** special sequence. For example, to get the first matching group, you'd use the special sequence."
