Install AWS CLI (on Mac)

$ curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
$ unzip awscli-bundle.zip
$ sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws

 # For the next step use the csv file created for you when your IAM user was created 
 (contains 'secret access key' and 'access key id' which will make accessing aws services
 programmatically much more convenient )

$ aws configure
