    "We want to start working with real data as quickly as possible, but using real data introduces a lot of complexity. In this Chapter, we start with a simple example that does not use real data but allow us to quickly get started doing computer simulation, visualizing data, and performing statistical tests. In {doc}`Chapter 3<../03-first-data/intro>`, we will use these skills to analyze a real data set on per-state Covid case rates and socioeconomic factors.\n",
