    "Simulation is a key technique used in this book to explore random phenomena. Thus, it is important to understand the simulation techniques we use for different scenarios. Consider again the Magician's Coin problem, and let $H_i$ denote the event that the coin comes up heads on the $i$th flip. In {doc}`simulating-cond-probs`, we investigated $P(H_2|H_1)$, the probability of getting Heads on a second flip of the chosen coin given that heads was observed on the first flip.  If we apply the definition of conditional probability from {doc}`definition`, then we can calculate this probability as \n",

    "However, in {doc}`simulating-cond-probs`, we did not estimate either $P(H_1 \\cap H_2)$ or $P(H_1)$.  Instead, we counted the proportion of times that we observed the outcome $H_2$ when $H_1$ was the outcome of the first flip.  Let's see why these produce the same result.\n",

    "\n",
    "In simulations of single events, if we think we know the approximate probability of the event, we can use that probability to estimate the number of trials needed to estimate it. For example, if we are estimating a probability $P(A)$ that we believe is close to 0.1, then we can estimate that the event $A$ occurs approximately once in every $1/P_A=10$ trials. If we capture 100 instances of $A$ occurring, we will get a good estimate of $P(A)$, so we might use this information to simulate $100/P_A=1000$ trials.\n",

    "We can estimate the values of these counters as follows. (We will formalize the meaning of these estimates later in the book when we talk about expected values/ensemble means.) $N_A$ will be approximately equal to the number of trials times $P(A)$, so it will be approximately equal to $111 P(A)= 0.11$. In other words, in 111 trials, most of the time we will not see any event $A$ occur. The estimated value of counter $N_{AB}$ will be the estimated number of trials in which we see both $A$ and $B$ occur, which will be approximately equal to $111 P(A \\cap B) \\approx 0.1$. **If we only use  the conditional probability information, we may severely underestimate the number of trials required to observe a sufficient number of events.**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Rightarrow$ When determining a sufficient number of trials for a simulation of a conditional probability $P(B|A)$, we must determine the required number of trials from the (estimated) value of $P(A \\cap B)$, if known. If no information about $P(A \\cap B)$ is available, the value of $N_{AB}$ should be checked at the end of the simulation to make sure that a sufficient number of events (at least 10; 100 is better) were observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this effect, some people will code their simulation to run until $N_{AB}$ reaches a specific threshold. This will bias the estimate of the $P(B|A)$ for reasons that are beyond the scope of this book. However, the bias will be small if threshold is large (>100).\n",
