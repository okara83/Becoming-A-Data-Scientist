However, we want to develop random variables in such a way that we can take advantage of all of the properties of the *probability spaces* that we developed in {doc}`../04-probability1/axiomatic-prob`.  In this class, we will only consider the case of **real** random variables, but random variables can also be complex-valued.\n",

We may choose the letter to represent a particular quantity, such as representing a random time by $T$ or a random rate by $R$. For a generic random variable, we will usually use $X$. \n",
    "* We want to ask about the probability that a random variable's value lies in some set. Until now, we have used $P$ to denote either a probability or a probability measure. We will draw a distinction between these below, where we will write $\\operatorname{Pr}()$ to denote a probability and $P()$ to denote a particular probability measure.\n",
    "* We will have the need to provide notation for an arbitrary value that a random variable may take on. Such a value will be represented by the lower-case version of the letter used to denote the random variable. In other words, we can ask about the probability that the random variable $X$ takes on a value $x$, which we can write as $\\operatorname{P}(X=x)$. In particular, we can define functions this way; for instance, we can create a function of $x$ that returns $\\operatorname{Pr}(X=x)$ for each real $x$, like $p_X(x) = \\operatorname{Pr}(X=x)$.\n",

    "* As in the case of event classes and probability measures, it turns out that we cannot come up with a rule that will assign a meaningful probability to any arbitrary set of values that a random variable might take on. How can we choose reasonable sets of values to assign probability to, and how can we evaluate those probabilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach may seem a bit strange at first, but it defines random variables in a way that directly leverages our work on probability spaces. Suppose we have a probability space $(S, \\mathcal{F}, P)$, and we want to use the probability measure $P$ from this probability space to determine the probabilities for a random variable $X$.  Then if $B$ is a set of real values, we want to translate $\\operatorname{Pr}(X \\in B)$ to some probability $P(E_B)$, where $E_B \\in \\mathcal{F}$ is an event in our probability space. To achieve this, we must have that the outcomes (which do not have to be numbers) in $E_B$ correspond in some way to the real values in $B$. Since we need to be able to determine what outcomes in $E_B$ correspond to the set of reals $B$, then there must be a **function** that maps from the outcomes in $E_B$ to the real values in $B$.  We define the random variable $X$ as that function: it is a function that maps the outcomes in $S$ to the real line.\n",

    "From the figure and mathematical definition of $Y(s)$, we can see that $Y^{-1}(0) = \\left\\{TT \\right\\}$ and $Y^{-1}(1) = \\left\\{HH, HT, TH \\right\\}$. This is our first example where we see that multiple $s$ can map to the same value of a random variable. Thus even if we ask an equation like $P\\left[Y(s)=y \\right]$, the underlying event may contain multiple outcomes, as in this case. Given that the coin is fair, it is easy to see that the probability of each outcome is 1/4, so $P\\left[ Y(s) = 0 \\right] = 1/4$ and $P \\left[ Y(s) =1 \\right] = 3/4$. This is our first example of a random variable with unequal probabilities, and it was built from a fair experiment, in which each outcome has an equal probability of occurring."
