The cell type **determines how a cell is evaluated**.  When a cell is evaluated, the contents are parsed by either a Markdown render (for a Markdown cell) or the Python kernel (for a Code cell). Cells may be evaluated in many different ways. Here are a few of the typical ways that we will use:\n",

For example, it is always best to reset the Python kernel and run all of the cells in a notebook from top to bottom before sharing a Jupyter notebook with someone else (for example, before submitting an assignment). To do this, click on the `Kernel` menu and choose the `Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...` menu item.\n",

    "If you enter Markdown into a Code cell or Python into a Markdown cell, the results will not be what you intend.

    "\n",
    "You can save your work by choosing `Save Notebook` in Jupyter Lab's `File` menu, or by pressing the keyboard sequence listed next to that item in the menu. When you manually save your work in this way, Jupyter actually saves two copies of your work: it updates the `.ipynb` file that you see in the file list, and it also updates a *hidden* checkpoint file.  When you are updating your document, Jupyter will also autosave your work periodically -- the default is every 120s. When Jupyter autosaves, it only updates the .ipynb file. If Jupyter crashes or your quit it without saving your notebooks, your last autosaved work will be what you see in the .ipynb files. However, you can always revert to the version that your purposefully saved by using the `Revert Notebook to Checkpoint` item in the File menu. \n",
    "\n",
    "When starting new Jupyter notebooks, their initial name will be \"Untitled.ipynb\". You can easily rename your notebook in a couple of ways. First, you can choose the `Rename Notebook...` option from the file menu. As an alternative, you can right-click on the notebook in the left-hand Files panel and \n",
    "choose `Rename`. In both cases, be sure to only change the part of the notebook name that is in front of the `.ipynb` extension. The extension is used by Jupyter to recognize Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are finished working with a Jupyter notebook, I recommend you perform the following steps:\n",
    "1. First, from the `Kernel` menu, choose `Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...` This will clear the previous output from your work and rerun every cell from the top down. \n",
    "2. Check over your notebook carefully to make sure you haven't introduced any errors or produced any unexpected results from having been able to execute cells out of order and from deleting cells or their content. By performing these first two steps, you help make sure that someone else loading your notebook will be able to reproduce your work.\n",
    "3. Check the notebook file name and update if necessary.\n",
    "4. Save the notebook.\n",
    "5. Choose `Close and Shutdown Notebook` from Jupyter's `File` menu. \n",
    "6. If you are completely finished working in Jupyter Lab, then choose `Shut Down` from Jupyter's `File` menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common workflow in Jupyter Lab is to use an existing notebook as a starting point for a new notebook. Again, there are several ways to do this:\n",
    "* If you already have the existing notebook open, then you can save it under a new name by choosing `Save Notebook As...` from Jupyter's `File` menu and giving the notebook a new name. **Note that after you use this option, the notebook that is open in the main work are will be the notebook with the new name. You will no longer be working on the original notebook.**\n",
    "* You can also duplicate a notebook by right-clicking on the notebook's name in the File panel on the left-hand side and choosing `Duplicate`. A copy of the notebook will be created with the name of the existing notebook appended with a suffix like `-Copy1` before the `.ipynb`."
