How can we get the data to answer this type of question and how can we be confident that the answers we get are not caused by randomness in the underlying data?

    "In {doc}`Chapter 2<../02-first-stats/intro>` and {doc}`Chapter 3<../03-first-data/intro>`, we introduced our first statistical tests. In each of these chapters, the examples ended with a test that was designed to determine whether some observed effect was \"significant\" in the sense that it is unlikely to have occurred under some default condition. In {doc}`Chapter 3<../03-first-data/intro>`, we began to formalize this by defining this default condition as a *null hypothesis*. We then introduced null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) as a way to conduct a statistical test to determine if an observed result can simply be explained by randomness in the data and limitations in the sample size. \n",

    "This chapter provides a deeper and more detailed discussion of NHST and different ways to conduct these tests using resampling. To better understand such tests and how they are applied in this book, I start with a discussion of the different types of studies and experiments that are usually encountered in statistics."
