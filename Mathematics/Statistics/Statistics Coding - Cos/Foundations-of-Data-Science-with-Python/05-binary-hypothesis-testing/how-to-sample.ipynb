    "In {doc}`Section 3.3<../03-first-data/hypothesis-testing>`, I introduced one way to sample from the pooled data, bootstrap sampling. In this section, we will delve a little bit deeper into ways to sample from the pooled data and the different implications of these different ways. In general, sampling can either be *with replacement* or *without replacement*. Sampling with replacement is called bootstrapping. Sampling without replacement is called *permutation testing*. It is easiest to see the differences among these approaches if we use a small data set with unique values. Consider whether a professor's course grades increased after the professor was promoted.  The table below shows the average course grade for the graduate course EEE 5544 Stochastic Methods for Engineering I at the University of Florida over six semesters with the same professor:\n",

    "We begin by reconsidering bootstrap sampling, which is also simply called *bootstrapping*. **Bootstrapping is used when we want to better characterize a test statistic under a particular hypothesis.** Bootstrapping approximates drawing values from the sampling distribution of the test statistic by instead randomly sampling from the pooled data.  **Boostrapping uses sampling with replacement**, so a single value in the pooled data may appear multiple times in a test sample. As in {doc}`Section 3.3<../03-first-data/hypothesis-testing>`, we will use `npr.choice()` to sample from the pooled data; by default, `npr.choice()` samples *with replacement*. \n",

For 6 data points, there are only 720 permutations, but for 60 data points, there are approximately $8.3 \\times 10^{81}$ permutations, which is too large to enumerate. As an alternative, we can use a *Monte Carlo permutation test*, in which permutations are drawn at random from the set of all permutations. This is equivalent to sampling *without replacement*, which we can do in Python using `npr.choice()` with the keyword parameter `replace = False`.\n",

    "* The bootstrap test is generally the most popular test, although this varies with the particular research community. \n",
    "* The goal of the bootstrap test is to approximate drawing values from the sampling distribution of the test statistic. If the reason for resampling is focused on the sampling distribution of the test statistic, then a bootstrap test should be used. We will give an example in the next section.\n",
    "* If the goal of resampling is to break up any dependence on the data from the assignment to the underlying groups, then a permutation test makes the most sense. For instance, if each group represents a treatment, then the goal of resampling may be to break up the mapping of data to treatments; this would merit the use of a permutation test.\n",
    "* When the data is small, an exact permutation test can consider every possible mapping of data to groups. \n",
    "* Permutation tests are generally more conservative than bootstrap tests in the sense that they generally produce larger $p$-values and are thus less likely to reject the null hypothesis and indicate statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this book, we will primarily use bootstrap tests because of their simplicity and popularity. An exception is that we will use an exact permutation test for categorical data in {doc}`Chapter 12<../12-categorical-data/intro>`.  In the following section, we apply bootstrap tests on the questions we formulated about the impact of post-baccalaureate work on family wealth with the purpose of further investigating the meaning of $p$-values and how we can use full the bootstrap distribution of the test statistic to create confidence intervals."
