# A Complete Solutions Guide to Pishro-Nik's:
Introduction to Probability, Statistics and Random Processes
---

**Pishro-Nik's: [Introduction to Probability, Statistics and Random Processes](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/)  is a very accessible introductory probability and statistics book at a level of an undergraduate math/computer science/physics major.  I have detailed my solutions to all problems in the text (this is still a work in progress), which can be found freely online on the book's website.  A student solutions manual for the odd problems is available, but I believe my work on these problems can offer an alternative and sometimes more intuitive solution.  Additionally, I have transcribed the entire introduction to simulation chapter into Python and have made my Jupyter notebook for this chapter available [here](https://github.com/dsrub/solutions_to_probability_statistics/blob/master/chpt12/chapter_12.ipynb).**
