# PyDataNYC2019 - Introduction to Probability and Statistics

**NOTE:** as of 10/27/2019 this Tutorial is *very* much a work in progress. Stayed tune as PyData NYC is Nov. 4-6, as that data approaches this content should be much closer to ready.

This project contains a whirlwind introduction to probability and statistics that will be part of a tutorial session at PyData NYC 2019. The tutorial consists of 3 notebooks that will walk you through the stages of stastical analysis.

## Install Instructions

1. clone this project to your local machine:


`git clone git@github.com:willkurt/ProbAndStats-PyDataNYC2019.git`

2. Go into project directory:

`cd ProbAndStats-PyDataNYC2019`

3. Create a virtual environment for this project

`python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`

4. Activate the virtual environment

`source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate`

5. Pip install the requirments (make sure your at the project's root directory)

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

6. Run the jupyter notebook and you should be all set!

`jupyter notebook`


## About this Tutorial

The aim of this tutorial is to give you a 90 minutes overview covering as much ground as is possible in understanding statics. There is *a lot* to take in, so if you're going to 90 minutes don't worry about throughly understanding everything. The goal here is just so that you get a sense of what probability and statistics is all about and also understand some ideas about how to solve problems using statistics and what all those fancy tools like `pymc3` are doing. If you have more than 90 minutes then spending some extra time playing with the notebooks here should provide you with a pretty strong background in how to think about problems statistically.
